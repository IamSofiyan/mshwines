The hiring of the famed oenologist, Michel Rolland, the beginning of malolactic fermentation in barrel (started in 1994), a stricter selection process, and the construction of a superb new cuverie are all signs that Leoville-Poyferre is set to emerge as one of the stars of the northern Medoc. The dark ruby/purple-colored 1994 offers up scents of toasty vanilla and sweet blackcurrant fruit. This medium-bodied claret possesses good fat, moderate tannin, and a traditional, backward, overall feel. Although still youthful, there is enough fruit to balance out the wine's tannin. This should develop into an excellent wine with 2-3 more years of cellaring. Anticipated maturity: 2000-2015.|0|Red wine|5382|750ml

Medium to full-bodied, elegant and loaded with an inner framework of minerality and moderately high tannins, this backward, but stylish, concentrated Canon will benefit from 7-8 years of cellaring and last for three decades. 2019-2049|12|Red wine|5636|750ml

Freshly cut flowers, raspberries, spices, mint and licorice burst from the glass as this fabulous, viscerally thrilling wine shows off its pure class. Today the oak is a bit prominent, but that won’t be an issue by the time the wine is ready to drink. In one of my blind tastings, the 2009 Solaia was flat-out great. There is no shortage of pedigree here. The 2009 has calmed down a little from its youth, when it was a much more exuberant wine, and has now begun to close down in bottle. Solaia is 75% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Sangiovese and 5% Cabernet Franc from a single parcel within the Antinori family’s Tignanello vineyard. Anticipated maturity: 2019-2029. Longtime winemaker Renzo Cotarella has done a fabulous job with the flagships Tignanello and Solaia in 2009. In my blind tastings the pedigree of those two wines in particular came through with notable eloquence. The 2010 Tignanello and Solaia are both thrilling at this stage. They could very well turn out even better than the 2009s. Readers may want to look at my short video on the 2010s from Antinori on our website|5|Red wine|5653|750ml

A final blend of 78% Cabernet Sauvignon, 19% Merlot and the rest Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot that hit 14.5% natural alcohol, this wine (which represents only 55% of the estate's production) is full-bodied, classic and built along the lines of the 2000 (although that wine was made before Reybier acquired the estate and upgraded quality significantly). This wine exhibits beautifully pure notes of creme de cassis, blueberry liqueur, pen ink, graphite and hints of toast and vanillin. The wine is full and rich, and although aged in 80% new oak, the wood is a subtle background component. This beauty will take longer to round into shape than the dramatic and compelling 2009. Forget it for 5-8 years, and drink it over the following three-plus decades. These are two terrific wines from Cos d'Estournel. Proprietor Michel Reybier will have to continue his great success over the next decade without his top lieutenant, Jean-Guillaume Prats, who has taken another job, but the estate seems to be in superlative condition, and at the very top of its game.|12|Red wine|5679|750ml

Gilles Pauquet is the consultant and has done an exemplary job with this particular estate.|11|Red wine|5714|750ml

Dense purple, with an extraordinary nose of sweet forest floor, blackberry jam, pen ink and graphite, this wine soars from the glass, giving it an aromatic dimension and intensity I have never seen from this estate. The tannins are present, as they are in most Cantenac Browns, but the wine’s sweetness, broad, skyscraper-like mouthfeel, dense, purple color and spectacular length (close to a minute) make this a giant classic and a fabulous sleeper of the vintage that still remains under-priced, considering how great its potential may be. This is a wine for those with cold cellars and youthful DNA. It is going to need at least a decade of cellaring and should last for 20-40 years. A classic! 2023-2063|9|Red wine|5715|750ml

Never one of my favorite wines, the 2010 is certainly a major, if not dramatic, improvement. Deep, subtle, herbaceous black currant fruit, cedar and Christmas fruitcake jump from the glass of this medium to full-bodied, ripe, well-made wine, which displays some subtle oak as well as excellent ripeness, texture and length. It should drink well for at least 15 or more years. This under-achieving estate, which is under the same management as Chateau Lilian Ladouys, seems to have made a huge step forward with this wine. 2013-2028|27|Red wine|5717|750ml

It does indeed possess the elegance and finesse of its bigger sibling, Leoville Las Cases. Drink it over the next 10-15 years. Clos de Marquis is no longer a second wine, but rather one from a separate vineyard in the holdings of Leoville Las Cases. It should be thought of as a different entity, although the same winemaking team and philosophy are at play. 2013-2028|12|Red wine|5718|750ml

One would have to go back to the 2005, 1947 or 1961 to find this level of quality from this ancient, historic vineyard planted adjacent to the walls of St.-Emilion, on the Cote Pavie. Dating back to the 1400s, this estate has been owned for over three centuries by the Malet-Roquefort family. Composed of 80% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Franc (in the past it was two-thirds Merlot and the rest split between Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc), the 2009 reveals compelling elegance, tremendous intensity and opulence and more viscosity than one normally sees. Lots of kirsch, licorice, incense, truffle, asphalt, blackberry and cassis notes dominate the aromatics and flavors of this full-bodied, viscous, fabulously pure, flamboyant St.-Emilion. Drinking it now may be considered infanticide by some consumers, but it is already attractive, and should last for 3-4 decades. 2012-2052|24|Red wine|5723|750ml

This beauty can be drunk now or cellared for 15-20 years. A beautiful example of wine from this estate, which is using well-known consultant Stephane Derenoncourt, finished 2010 at 14.5% natural alcohol, and seems to be one of the sexier, more developed and evolved styles of the vintage.|4|Red wine|5726|750ml

Supple and full-bodied, with a powerful mouthfeel and a hint of graphite, this is a deep rich, full-throttle, very sexy and opulent Rouget to drink over the next 15 or more years. 2013-2028|23|Red wine|5728|750ml

A beautiful wine, stunningly opulent, accessible and almost atypically forward, it is plump and delicious already, and in that sense, it is almost reminiscent of the 2009. Deep ruby/plum/purple, with juicy black raspberry and black currant fruit as well as hints of cedar, licorice, forest floor and underbrush, the 2010 is medium to full-bodied, layered, round and impossible to resist already. It should drink beautifully for 20-25 years. 2013-2038|0|Red wine|5734|750ml
Watermark2014Lascombes 2010jpg.jpg|RP96 |M0000383|Lascombes|2eme Cru|2010|Margaux|HK$ 880.0|France|The wine hits all cylinders in 2010. The average alcohol for the bottled wine is 14%. It has a gorgeously sweet nose of creme de cassis, spring flowers, subtle barbecue smoke and charcoal followed by full body, beautiful intensity, great purity, stature and length. The influence of any oak is minimal, despite the fact that 90% new French oak was used. Needless to say, this is an example of modern-styled winemaking at it’s finest, and arguments that such wines will not age well, do not represent their terroir , and are soul-less, are totally groundless. Give it 5 or so years of cellaring and drink it over the following 25-30 years. This is one of the great Margaux wines of the vintage. 2018-2048 Probably the greatest Lascombes made to date, the 2010 is a blend of 55% Merlot, 45% Cabernet Sauvignon and the rest Petit Verdot. The production from this huge estate totals nearly 400,000 bottles|14|Red wine|5735|750ml

It is a broad, powerful and more muscular wine than its cross-street rival, La Chapelle de la Mission, but all the same, it is wonderfully fresh and precise, with notes of blueberry and boysenberry as well as hints of smoke and wet stones. Endowed with gorgeous fruit, texture, purity and elegance, this relatively dense second wine demonstrates how draconian the selection process has become for the top estates in Bordeaux in recent years. The blend of this wine is 52% Merlot, 36% Cabernet Sauvignon and the rest mostly Cabernet Franc with just a touch of Petit Verdot. I would expect it to last at least 20 years, which is remarkable. Kudos to the team at Haut-Brion and to the proprietors, the Dillon family, who are now represented admirably and meticulously by Prince Robert of Luxembourg. He has made some changes, and all of them seem to have resulted in dramatic improvements to what was already an astonishing group of wines. 2013-2033|16|Red wine|5736|750ml

This wine is essentially three-fourths Merlot and the rest Cabernet Franc. Rivaling the brilliant 2009, thirty percent of the production from this monstrously sized estate made it into this wine, which offers up plenty of white chocolate, cassis and mulberry as well as a hint of roasted herbs. With fleshy, round flavors, full-bodied texture and an amazing finish, this is no second wine, and considerably better than some of the Cheval Blancs of the 1960s and 1970s!

Jean-Charles Cazes, who took over for his father a number of years ago, has produced a magnificent wine with the classic creme de cassis note intermixed with smoke, graphite and spring flowers. It is a massive Lynch Bages, full-bodied and very 1989-ish, with notable power, loads of tannin, and extraordinary concentration and precision. This is not a Lynch Bages to drink in its exuberant youth, but one to hold on to for 5-6 years and drink over the following three decades. 2018-2048|36|Red wine|5738|750ml

An opaque blue/black color suggests a wine with thrilling levels of concentration and intensity, and That's exactly what a taster gets. Subtle smoke, incense and Asian spice (soy?) notes interwoven with graphite, blueberry, blackberry and cassis characteristics lead to a full-bodied, phenomenally concentrated, viscous, opulent wine with plenty of sweet tannin. This sensational Palmer reveals even more floral notes than vintages such as 2005 and 2000. It should drink well for 50 years. 2012-2062|12|Red wine|5983|1500ml

|RP92 |M0000977|Lamborghini Campoleone|IGT|2005|Umbria|HK$ 380.0|Italy|The estate’s top bottling, the 2005 Campoleone, is a cuvee of equal parts Sangiovese and Merlot that spent 12 months in French oak. A full-bodied, racy red, the wine possesses compelling layers of dark cherries, licorice, mint, tobacco, sweet herbs and French oak in an elegant, beautifully balanced style. Today the wine comes across as quite primary, but it should develop nicely with time in the bottle. Anticipated maturity: 2010-2020.|11|Red wine|6060|750ml
|RP91 |M0000978|Lamborghini Campoleone|IGT|2006|Umbria|HK$ 380.0|Italy|Dark cherries, smoke, licorice and earthiness are some of the nuances that emerge from 2006 Campoleone, a blend of Sangiovese and Merlot that spent 12 months in French oak. This is a decidedly dark, brooding red from Lamborghini. As good as it is, I can’t help feeling that the wine is trapped by excessive concentration and new oak. With a lighter touch this could be a truly important, benchmark wine for Umbria. Anticipated maturity: 2012-2021.|12|Red wine|6061|750ml
|RP94 |M0000979|Lamborghini Campoleone|IGT|2010|Umbria|HK$ 480.0|Italy|The 2010 Campoleone is the best I have tasted thus far. This blended Umbrian red (50-50 Sangiovese and Merlot) opens with an inky black color and extreme elegance that hits at the very core. Shapely fruit tones of blackberry and dried cherry are enhanced by balsam herb, licorice, sweet spice, tobacco, forest floor and flower potpourri. The close is soft, long lasting and ripe. I look forward to revisiting this wine in six or seven years when it has completed its evolution. Drink: 2015-2024.|6|Red wine|6062|750ml

|AM95 |M0000982|Joseph Drouhin Bonnes Mares Grand Cru|Grand Cru (Burgundy)|2008|Burgundy|HK$ 499.0|France|Allen Meadows: A strikingly complex, highly expressive and almost surprisingly elegant nose of spicy red and blue pinot fruit aromas nuanced by hints of violets and warm earth nuances that are also picked up by the rich and particularly full-bodied flavors that possess a natural sweetness, which serves to buffer the firm tannins on the wonderfully persistent finish. The fine balance is absolutely impeccable and the length is flat out amazing plus I love the underlying sense of tension. A simply superb Bonnes Mares but be prepared to have ample patience. Robert Parker: “2008 was very slow in doing its malolactic – which was good, and ended up with a pretty lively impression of acidity” remarked Veronique Boss-Drouhin, “and I think the wines will be slow to evolve in bottle, as well.” Numerous cuvees were still in tank or barrel when I visited in March, which constitutes an unusually late schedule at this address. The 2007s, by contrast, were bottled even earlier than normal, most at age 12 months. In 2008, a 15-25% share of stems and whole clusters was included in the fermenting vat for the Clos des Mouches and for most of the Drouhin grand crus, whereas in 2007 that degree of vendange entier was practically the rule across the entire Drouhin range (by no means all of which I tasted).|0|Red wine|6065|750ml
|RP91 |M0000983|Fontanafredda Vigna La Rosa|DOCG|2005|Barolo|HK$ 650.0|Italy|The 2005 Barolo La Rosa is a graceful, floral wine laced with perfumed red fruit, roses, sweet spices and minerals. The La Rosa possesses gorgeous textural richness in a soft, approachable style, with a long, refined finish that rounds things out. Today the wine comes across as quite primary, but with some additional time in bottle it should develop additional tertiary nuance. The tannins gain on the finish in this deceptively medium- bodied Barolo. Anticipated maturity: 2012-2022. These 2005s are the finest Barolos I can recall tasting here. The estate seems to have toned down the super-ripe style of recent years and the results are striking. As I have written here before, Fontanafredda owns some of the most prized vineyards in all of Piedmont, and clearly has potential for making important wines of the highest level.|6|Red wine|6066|750ml

The bouquet has a level of delineation, sweetness, inner perfume and nuance generally only found in Giacosa’s Red Label Riservas. The Falletto impresses for the intensity of its dark fruit and superb overall balance. The extroverted personality of the vintage is quite evident, especially as the wine sits in the glass. Menthol, flowers and licorice add the final notes of complexity on the finish. This is an especially racy Barolo from Bruno Giacosa, but the trademark elegance is there. Anticipated maturity: 2017-2032.|2|Red wine|6067|750ml

The Riserva is a decidedly dark, brooding wine in this vintage. Scorched earth, smoke, menthol, licorice and new leather flow with marvelous intensity all the way through to the powerful finish. Over time the classic Giacosa bouquet of dried rose petal emerges, rounding out this fabulous effort in grand style. The imposing tannins will require a measure of patience, but the 2007 Riserva is shaping up to be another magnificent, towering Barolo from Bruno Giacosa.

Rosehip, forest berry, wild mint, lightly toasted pine nut, dried ginger and underbrush all appear on the ever-changing bouquet. The wine is extremely finessed and silky on the close with beautiful menthol freshness at the end. In Barolo tradition, fruit was normally sourced from many vineyards. The concept of single vineyards is relatively new. In keeping with tradition, this Barolo sees fruit from the Canubbi, San Lorenzo, Rue, and Rocche di La Morra vineyards.

|RP87 |M0000994|Joseph Drouhin Gevrey Chambertin|Village (Burgundy)|2008|Cote de Nuits|HK$ 499.0|France|Tart cherry and smoked meat dominate the Drouhin 2008 Gevrey-Chambertin – which I tasted from tank – and its interchange of fresh juiciness, tart berry skin, and tea-like bitterness and tannin is far more enjoyable than the rather tough, gum-numbing facade of the corresponding village-level Nuits-St.-Georges. This should remain enjoyable for at least 4-5 years, but there’s no question you can buy a lot more charm for a lot less money elsewhere in the same portfolio. “2008 was very slow in doing its malolactic – which was good, and ended up with a pretty lively impression of acidity” remarked Veronique Boss-Drouhin, “and I think the wines will be slow to evolve in bottle, as well.” Numerous cuvees were still in tank or barrel when I visited in March, which constitutes an unusually late schedule at this address.

|RP88 |M0000995|Joseph Drouhin Gevrey Chambertin|Village (Burgundy)|2009|Gevrey Chambertin|HK$ 499.0|France|The 2009 Gevrey-Chambertin is a plump wine best suited to drinking while the fruit retains its juiciness. Anticipated maturity: 2011-2017. Drouhin farms 75 hectares of vineyards according to biodynamic principles. Maceration and fermentation lasts about three weeks. The wines are then racked into oak in a cold part of the cellar to slow down the malos, although in 2009 they were entirely done by December. The estate leaves the wines on their lees for several months with one racking, or two if needed, prior to being assembled for bottling. New oak ranges from 25% for the entry-level wines to 50-65% for the grand crus. Veronique Drouhin thinks the 2009s will stay open throughout their lives, much as the 1985s have. All of these 2009s were bottled between early December, 2010 and January, 2011.|0|Red wine|6077|750ml

While opulent, underneath the full-bodied richness of fruit and depth is a structured wine. As it sits in the glass, an espresso roast character (no doubt from new oak) also emerges. Enjoy this pure, structured, fleshy beauty between 2010-2025.|0|Red wine|6078|750ml

|RP99 |M0001005|Montrose|2eme Cru|2010|St. Estephe|HK$ 1,900.0|France|The 2010 Montrose is a fabulous wine, and I was leaning toward giving it a three-digit score, which it may ultimately merit after it resolves some of its very sweet tannin. It is not as soft or flamboyant as the 2009, but it is a great classic, coming in at 13.9% natural alcohol. Representing 64% of the total production, the final blend is 53% Cabernet Sauvignon, 37% Merlot, 9% Cabernet Franc and 1% Petit Verdot (which is one percent different than the barrel sample blends that were presented). Inky bluish/purple in color, with classic blueberry, black currant, crushed rock and floral notes, hints of graphite, and lots of wild mountain berry fruit, this wine is extravagantly rich, has very sweet but noticeable tannin, laser-like precision, a massive, full-bodied mouthfeel and a finish of close to 50+ seconds. This remarkable wine will probably tighten up somewhat in the bottle, and need most of a decade to shed some tannin and its rather grapy, primary personality. The finish blew me away, and the overall power, richness and balance of this wine are virtually perfect. Look for it to drink well for half a century or more.|0|Red wine|6087|750ml

It is a deep purple-hued, charming, surprisingly open-knit Pauillac with wonderful freshness, a plump, fleshy mouthfeel, opulence and unctuosity, medium to full body and a well-delineated, luscious style. More elegant than its nearby neighbor, Pichon Longueville Baron, and not as massive in concentration and extract, it is one of the great Pichon Lalandes of the last twenty years.|0|Red wine|6088|750ml

While the structure has largely been resolved there is still some firmness to the impressively persistent finish.

However the mid-palate is intensely sappy and concentrated with gorgeously detailed flavors that offer knock out intensity, building slowly from the attack all the way to the explosive finish and lingers for minutes. As impressive as the wine is however, the structure has begun to assert itself and thus this will need another 6 to 10 or be at its best.

Under blind conditions, the Yquem 2007 shines like a diamond. Nevertheless, it is initially rather taciturn on the nose, eventually opening up beautifully with touches of lemon curd, Mirabelle, and clear honey. The palate is medium-bodied with very fine definition and there seems to be a great deal of energy and vigor dispensed for your pleasure.

Nevertheless, there is plenty to admire in this full-bodied, very lush Cheval Blanc that has reached full maturity. Sweet notes of red and black fruits intermixed with licorice, spice box, and incense jump from the glass. On the palate, the wine is full-bodied, layered, very rich, and seems to develop interesting nuances the more it sits in the glass, and then suddenly take a dive.
